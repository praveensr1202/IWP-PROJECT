WORKFORCE
The primary goal is to build a website that acts as a platform which enables skilled and experienced professionals to connect with users looking for specific services. 
Because of the current pandemic, we have to be always very cautious. But there are certain needs and requirements in our life that can’t be ignored. These needs and requirements just don’t vanish because of the pandemic or take into consideration some of the strict rules imposed by the government on us. Many people have lost their jobs thanks to the pandemic. 
Our idea offers these people fresh hope. Anyone can register and list the service they offer in our website. We display it to our users who search for these services. 
Our website charges no money from the service provider. It just acts as a platform through which service providers can list all the services they offer to a wider audience and customers can search for quality professionals who are willing to offer the particular service our customer is looking for.
The services offered by the professionals registered with WorkForce website are all home services and these services are all offered on demand. 
We identify and display professionals who are closest to the users’ requirements and also currently online at the time of users’ searching for a service in WorkForce. From the list of registered professionals displayed on a users’ query for a service, the user can choose any professional he/she wants too.
